This Jupyter notebook will walk you through a procedure to download publicly available data from the Danish building registry (BBR) and import it into a PostgresQL relational database.
I hope you find it useful!
As always, feel free to modify it as you see fit, and don't hesitate to reach out.
Also, whatever you do with the data, don't forget to clean it first - BBR has more than a few incorrect and incomplete entries. For more on that topic, check out https://github.com/NFrancart/iBuildGreen
